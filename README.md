# Personal attempts at solving Everybody Codes 2025 in Python (+ numPy)

In every `d{day}` folder there are my solutions to that day's problems (as `p{part}.py`).
The day's inputs sit in that folder in files named `input{part_number}` (I don't publish them here).

The programs get their input from a stdin (that might require an end of stream).
This can be accomplished, for instance, by:

- redirecting the input file into the program,
- heredocs,
- typing the input followed by a `^D`.

The quests were solved within 24 hours of their release.
